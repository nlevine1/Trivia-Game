# Trivia-Game

 
The 2018 FIFA World Cup is underway! With that, I decided to make a simple trivia game. The quiz is like any other quiz, except I am testing your knowledge of World Cup History. 
  I threw in a few curve balls! Good luck! 
  
If you like soccer, hopefully you'll enjoy this quiz. You can check out the quiz by clicking on the below link!

I still need to figure out a working reset function that resets the radio selections of the quiz. All suggestions are welcome! 

Thanks!
